<h1>Reducing Forest Fires</h1>
<p>
    This idea involves the use of advanced technology to combat forest fires effectively. 
    Smart sensors can detect temperature changes and smoke in real time, enabling rapid response teams to act before fires spread. 
    Drones equipped with fire suppression systems can also assist in managing fires in remote areas.
